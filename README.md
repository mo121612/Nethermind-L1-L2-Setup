# Nethermind-L1-L2-Setup
This repository documents my setup and exploration of **Nethermind Layer 1 (Ethereum)** and **Layer 2 (Surge)** blockchain clients.   The project was completed as part of a learning exercise and hackathon opportunity led by **Dr. Bill Buchanan**. 

---

## 🚀 Overview  

This project focuses on deploying and integrating **Ethereum Layer 1 (L1)** and **Layer 2 (L2)** environments using **Nethermind** and the **Surge architecture**.  

- **Layer 1 (L1):** Ethereum client setup with Nethermind using Kurtosis.  
- **Layer 2 (L2):** Surge architecture for scalability and off-chain transaction handling.  
- **Smart contracts:** Developed and deployed using **Hardhat**.  
- **Wallet integration:** Configured with **MetaMask** and tested contract interactions.  
- **Blockchain exploration:** Implemented using **Blockscout** to monitor and verify transactions.

## 🧩 Components and Setup  

### 🔹 1. Nethermind with Kurtosis (Layer 1)  
- Basic installation of Nethermind in an enclave environment.  
- Defined and tested the L1 node setup using Kurtosis.  


### 🔹 2. Web3 Integration  
- Connected to the Nethermind node through Web3 for blockchain communication.  
- Verified transactions and smart contract interactions.  


### 🔹 3. Smart Contract Deployment (Hardhat)  
- Created Solidity contracts using **Hardhat**.  
- Demonstrated contract deployment and state changes on the Ethereum ledger.  


### 🔹 4. Token Creation (ERC-20)  
- Developed an ERC-20 token to illustrate state changes within smart contracts.  
- Verified token transfers via the connected wallet.  

### 🔹 5. MetaMask Integration  
- Integrated **MetaMask** with the local ledger.  
- Tested user transactions and wallet connectivity.  


### 🔹 6. NFT Creation (ERC-721)  
- Deployed an ERC-721 contract to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  
- Verified NFT metadata and ownership using the explorer.  

### 🔹 7. Blockscout Installation  
- Installed and configured **Blockscout**, an open-source blockchain explorer.  
- Used Blockscout to view transactions, contract data, and account balances on the L1 network.
